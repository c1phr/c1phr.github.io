I'm Ryan Batchelder: Computer Science student at [Northern Arizona Univeristy](http://nau.edu/cefns) seeking graduation in 2016, [hobbiest photographer](https://500px.com/c1phr), avid coffee drinker and hockey fan. My programming interests are primarily in web and mobile development. I currently do work as a student ASP.NET developer (both Web Forms and MVC) and have started dabbling in Node.JS and Swift on the side.

I'm seeking a job for post-graduation. If you're an interested recruiter, send me an email (link above) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdbatch02).

For everyone else: feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/c1phr) or via email, I love to talk about almost anything tech-related and I love learning from others.
