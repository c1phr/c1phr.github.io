I'm Ryan Batchelder: Entry Level Software Developer at [Liberty Mutual Insurance Group](https://www.libertymutual.com), [Northern Arizona Univeristy](http://nau.edu/cefns) alumnus with a BS in Computer Science, [hobbiest photographer](https://500px.com/c1phr), avid coffee drinker and hockey fan. My programming interests are primarily in web and mobile development. Most of my experience is in C# ASP.NET and Python, but I've begun working in Java Spring and AngularJS among other languages.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/c1phr) or via email, I love to talk about almost anything tech-related and I love learning from others. Also checkout my open source work on [Github](https://github.com/c1phr).
