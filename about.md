I'm Ryan Batchelder: Computer Science student at [Northern Arizona Univeristy](http://nau.edu/cefns) seeking graduation in 2016, [hobbiest photographer](https://500px.com/c1phr), avid coffee drinker and hockey fan. My programming interests are primarily in web and mobile development. I currently work as a software developer with Liberty Mutual Insurance. Most of my experience is in C# ASP.NET and Python, but I've begun working in Java Spring and AngularJS among other languages.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/c1phr) or via email, I love to talk about almost anything tech-related and I love learning from others.
