So, I've been working on an app in my spare time. No, not the next VC funded Silicon Valley product, but just something that I can invest some time into for the sake of learning new things. Obviously, I want this app to be relatively successful, so I'm doing my best to keep that in mind when planning things like tech stack. I'll probably talk more about this app one day soon, but for now, I'll just include some pertinent background info. Like with most basic apps, I need some sort of server-side component to hand up-to-date data to client devices, and maybe gather a bit in the process (for social components of the app, not weird spying things). My original client devices are going to be iOS since I want to work on a serious Swift project, and because it's the easiest for me to test.

 I wanted to start by building the framework for the server-side backend first. This is going to be really simple at first, and easy to add features to later. Since one of the major goals of this project was to learn something new, I've been trying to avoid using technologies that I'm already very comfortable with while still being practical to release. This (along with Azure pricing) ruled out ASP.NET Web API, despite how much I love C#. I also looked at AWS, Google App Engine and spinning up my own serve on a Digital Ocean box. All of these routes were financially viable on my college student budget, but each had tradeoffs.
 
 The PaaS route with Google App Engine was very appealing due to the relatively generous free-tier. I also discovered that they provided a service called [Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/) which seemed to provide all the API building features that I wanted in a nice package. I actually started to build on this platform for about a week before discovering that documentation is scarce (as appears to be a new norm for Google, don't get me started on the Maps API) and there are a lot of platform quirks that I simply didn't have the time to work out. Additionally, there was an uncomfortably large amount of "platform lock" that comes from writing code for App Engine. It becomes very hard to port to another platform or host later down the road, and I wasn't ready to commit to staying on App Engine for the foreseeable future.
 
 Around the same time that this was happening, I started playing with [MEAN](http://mean.io/#!/) at work. Node.JS has always seemed like a cool technology, but I always remember that I don't really like JavaScript every time I start working through a tutorial. In this case, I forced myself to learn enough to write some [really basic training on setting up a MEAN stack](http://batchofcode.com/mean_tutorial/) for some co-workers and decided to give it go in my project. Yeah, I knew that this was going to spark my platform dilemma all over again, but I figured that I could just start on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) box and move on from there later. I started with a basic Express server hosting some endpoints that were tied to some simple Mongo models. Along the way, I found [a library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mers) that helped take some of the grunt work out of writing the basic CRUD. This made me actually start to like working with the stack, but I was still running into issues that were getting annoying to debug with my relatively limited understanding of Express and Mongo (I was entirely new to MongoDB and NoSQL, too). Finally I got to the point where I wasn't having fun anymore, and I attributed that almost entirely to JavaScript, so I changed backends one more time...
 
 ...to Django. I've had my share of time spent with Django, but most of the work is going to be done with [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org) which I have minimal experience with. So yes, this partially goes against my "learn something new", but I've definitely already made up for that in what I've learned about Django REST Framework in far less time than it took me to setup the Node.JS version. Now I can really get started on what I'm most excited about, the iOS app.
 
I've already made up my mind that the iOS component will be built in Swift. Since it was announced last year at WWDC, I've been super interested in actually applying Swift to a real project. I've played with it in a couple of [little](https://github.com/c1phr/CodeExcusesWidget) ["toy"](https://github.com/c1phr/MessageTweet) [projects](https://github.com/c1phr/iMessageBridge), but this will be my first time using it on something that I want to release to the world. I have a little bit of the app written so far, but I'm hoping to write about it when I get a little further along and actually have something interesting to talk about.

Did I switch frameworks a few too many times? Maybe. Did I learn something along the way? Definitely. Have you gone through something similar or have some advice for me on something I might have missed? Let me know below or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/c1phr)!
